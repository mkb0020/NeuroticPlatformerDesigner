# 🧮 NEUROTIC LEVEL DESIGN CALCULATOR

A physics-based level design tool for 2D platformer developers who want **perfectly spaced, symmetrical, and mathematically valid platform layouts**.

Built for the neurotic among us who crave **consistency, balance, and repeatability** instead of guesswork.

## 📐 WHAT IS THIS?

The **NEUROTIC LEVEL DESIGN CALCULATOR** helps you design platformer levels using your game's physics, then export the results in formats that are actually useful in a game engine.

### It does two things:

- Calculates safe, consistent platform layouts using player physics

- Exports either:

    - A full detailed JSON (everything), or

    - A ZIP of per-level JSON files containing only ground segments and platforms, reformatted for engine use

## 🧠 WHAT IT CALCULATES

Based on your player physics and difficulty scaling, the calculator determines:

- Maximum jump distance

- Maximum jump height

- Safe horizontal platform gaps

- Platform start/end positions

- Ground segment placement

- Structured layouts across:

    - Multiple levels

    - Multiple gauntlets per level

### All calculations are derived from:

- Player speed

- Jump force

- Gravity

- Optional multipliers

No magic numbers. No eyeballing. Just math.

## 💥 FEATURES

- Physics-based jump calculations

- Multi-level & multi-gauntlet generation

- Consistent platform spacing per level

- Optional ground overlap tuning

- Clean, structured JSON output



## 🛑 CAVEATS (PLEASE READ)

Within a single level, this tool assumes:

- All platforms are the same width

- Horizontal spacing between platforms is uniform

- Each gauntlet contains the same number of platforms

- Distance between gauntlets is consistent

If you want everything symmetrical, evenly spaced, and predictable, you’re in the right place.
